# Stage-4-Task
To understand how Releaf can extend its services beyond rural farmers to include urban and young farmers (20–49 years old) through a more accessible, digital-first approach without changing its core user base
Company Name: Releaf
Product Industry: Agriculture

What this product does
Answer: Releaf Earth connects farmers to premium biochar, simple micro-loans, and climate smart tools. Farmers can learn about biochar, order product, request loans and leave reviews  via web, mobile app or USSD feature- phone user.

Why it matters
Answer: Smallholder farmers (who dominate production) use manual, inefficient processing methods (like cracking palm nuts with rocks), resulting in low processing yields and high post-harvest losses. Releaf converts agricultural waste to biochar, which sequesters carbon which improve soil fertility and create income. Releaf makes digital ordering and financing adoption easier and scaleable. 

Who it's for
Answer: Primary users are the rural farmers and the urban farmers (20 - 49 years).
Secondary users are the agricpreneurs and local processor.

Summary: This product expansion turns Releaf from a rural-only sustainability startup into a pan-African agri-climate platform that merges accessibility, technology, and sustainability.
It respects the existing USSD user base while future-proofing the company for younger, digitally connected farmers, closing the gap between impact and inclusion.
